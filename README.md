## **Motivation**
I wrote this program during my Spring Break of 2022. I was super bored and didn't have any hardware or microcontrollers to work with so, in an effort to kill time during break, I wrote this game. I wanted to write it in C++ so I could get some practice in as well as display to potential employers that I can write in C++ (among other languages). 

I chose this specific program because I thought it would be fun to create a clone of one of the games I play everyday. I knew some of the challenges would be a clean UI (i.e., no echoing the user's input as standard output) and the mechanics of the game (described below).
